2013 STEM ThInK Website
=====

ThInK is the name of our educational app comprised of three elementsâ€™ symbols from the Periodic Table of Elements: Thorium, Indium, and Potassium. ThInK is an interactive, fun, and unique study guide aimed to promote excitement and engagement towards Chemistry. This Study tool is geared towards high school students taking the New York State Regents and or those who want more practice in chemistry. ThInK allows them to further grasp chemistry topics they may have forgotten or did not fully understand. ThInK works with the student to prepare for the Regents through a series of games, score trackers, and a section for them to take their own notes and formulate that into their own study guide. The resources tab is meant to supply our users with reliable sources to help them gather more information necessary to pass the Chemistry Regents.
